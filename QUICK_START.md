## 🎯 What This Means For You

### Contact Form (ContactUsPage)

  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  phone: "9876543210",
  mobile: "9876543210",
  state: "Maharashtra",
  city: "Mumbai",
  reason: "Loan Assistance",
  subject: "Need help",
  message: "I need assistance with..."
}
```

**Backend now:**
- ✅ Saves ALL these fields to database
- ✅ Sends email to admin with all details
- ✅ Validates required fields
- ✅ Returns success/error messages

---

### Sign Up Page (SignUpPage)
**Frontend sends:**
```javascript
{

  password: "SecurePass123",
  phone: "9123456789",
  age: "28",
  gender: "Female",
  income: "₹5-10L",

}
```

**Backend now:**

```
